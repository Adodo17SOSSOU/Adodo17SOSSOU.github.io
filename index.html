          <h3>Brief academic bio</h3>
          <p>
            I am a machine learning engineer and researcher interested in
            <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>spatio-temporal models</strong>
            and <strong>medical imaging</strong>. I have successfully completed the
            Master’s programme <strong>Mathematics, Vision, Learning (MVA)</strong>
            at ENS Paris-Saclay / Université Paris Cité with distinction.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my Master’s thesis at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris),
            I work on <strong>Alzheimer’s disease progression modeling</strong>,
            combining self-supervised 3D MRI encoders with probabilistic
            longitudinal models. Previously, I studied Computer Science at
            Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, after an engineering cycle and
            intensive preparatory classes in mathematics, computer science and
            physics in Morocco.
          </p>

        <h3>Journey from Togo to France</h3>
        <p>
          I grew up in Togo, where my interest in mathematics, programming and education
          gradually converged into a passion for machine learning. After high school,
          I moved to <strong>Morocco</strong> to join the preparatory classes and the
          engineering cycle at <strong>ENSA Fès</strong>, supported by a fully funded
          scholarship. Those years gave me a strong foundation in mathematics,
          computer science and physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I moved to <strong>France</strong> to continue my studies in Computer
          Science at <strong>Université Sorbonne Paris Nord</strong>, and then to
          <strong>ENS Paris-Saclay</strong> for the MVA Master’s programme. This
          multi-country trajectory—Togo → Morocco → France—shaped both my scientific
          interests and my commitment to helping other students access international
          opportunities.

        <h3>Research interests</h3>
        <p>
          Broadly, I am interested in using machine learning to improve healthcare
          and our understanding of the brain. My current interests include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep learning for <strong>3D medical imaging</strong> (e.g. brain MRI).</li>
          <li><strong>Spatio-temporal</strong> and
              <strong>probabilistic</strong> modeling of disease progression.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-supervised representation learning</strong>.</li>
          <li>Robust speech recognition and time-series analysis for clinical data.</li>
          <li>Reproducible and reliable machine learning pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="open-positions">
        <h3>Open to MSc thesis and PhD opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          I am actively looking for <strong>Master’s thesis projects</strong> and
          <strong>PhD positions</strong> in machine learning for healthcare and
          neuroscience, especially involving 3D medical imaging, spatio-temporal
          modeling and probabilistic methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are working on related topics and are looking for a motivated
          student or research collaborator, I would be very happy to hear from you.

        <h3>Study abroad & Excellence Scholars</h3>
        <p>
          Navigating applications, scholarships and new academic systems has been a
          central part of my journey. To help others, I founded
          <strong>Excellence Scholars</strong>, an initiative to share information
          about <strong>excellence scholarships</strong> and study abroad opportunities
          with students from around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community now includes thousands of students across social networks and
          messaging groups. Our goal is simple: to make world-class education more
          accessible to ambitious students, regardless of their background.
